# SpendWise - Fix Task List

## üéØ Onboarding Issues ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Fix onboarding completion state persistence** - Modal keeps showing even after user clicked "Finish"
- [x] **Improve onboarding UX for returning incomplete users** - Replace forced onboarding with optional dialog
  - [x] Add detection for users who started but didn't complete onboarding
  - [x] Create small dialog asking "Looks like you didn't finish the onboarding experience. Would you like to continue or skip it?"
  - [x] Add "Continue Onboarding" and "Skip for Now" buttons
  - [x] Ensure skipping marks onboarding as completed
  - [x] Keep onboarding accessible via Help menu in header

**‚úÖ RESOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
- Enhanced `OnboardingModal.jsx` with proper completion handling and localStorage cleanup
- Created `OnboardingPromptDialog.jsx` for graceful optional prompts to incomplete users 
- Updated `Dashboard.jsx` with smart 3-state detection and persistent settings
- All builds passing, production-ready implementation

## üí∞ Balance Panel Critical Issue ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Fix balance display stuck on daily view for new users**
- [x] **Investigate why balance panel doesn't respond to time range changes (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)**
- [x] **Test with new vs old user accounts to identify the root cause**
- [x] **Check recent changes that might have affected this functionality**
- [x] **Ensure proper data filtering and display updates for all time ranges**

**üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
The critical bug was in the PostgreSQL `get_user_stats()` function in `server/db/05_final_touches.sql`. The function used the `daily_balances` VIEW which only includes users with actual transactions. New users with no transactions returned NULL values for `avg_daily_expense` and `avg_daily_income`, causing the Balance Panel to malfunction.

**‚úÖ TECHNICAL SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
1. **Database Fix**: Updated `get_user_stats()` function with `COALESCE()` defaults
   - Changed `AVG(expenses)` to `COALESCE(AVG(expenses), 0)`
   - Changed `AVG(income)` to `COALESCE(AVG(income), 0)`
   - Added additional `COALESCE()` safeguards in the SELECT clause

2. **Client-Side Safeguards**: Already existing in codebase
   - `numbers.processBalanceData()` handles corrupted data gracefully
   - `ensureBalanceFormat()` in BalancePanel provides fallbacks
   - Error handling and loading states properly implemented

**üéØ IMPACT:** 
- New users now see proper balance data (all zeros) instead of undefined/null
- Balance Panel responds correctly to time range changes for all users
- No more "stuck on daily view" behavior
- Consistent experience between new and existing users
