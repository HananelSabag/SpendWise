## 🚀 Quick Start (For Learning & Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 8+
- PostgreSQL database (or Supabase account)
- Gmail account for email services (optional)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HananelSabag/SpendWise.git
cd SpendWise
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd ../server
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

**Note**: You'll need to create your own environment files as they're not included in the repository for security reasons.

**Server (.env in server/ directory):**
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret-key

# Email (optional)
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
```

**Client (.env in client/ directory):**
```env
# API Configuration
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

### 4. Database Setup

Run the database migrations (if using local PostgreSQL):
```bash
cd server
npm run migrate
```

For Supabase, import the provided SQL schema file.

### 5. Start Development Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## 📱 Mobile Development

The application supports mobile development with network access:

```bash
# Start with network access for mobile testing
cd client
npm run dev:mobile

# Your mobile device can access the app at:
# http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5173
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run frontend tests (Vitest)
cd client
npm run test

# Run frontend tests with coverage
cd client
npm run test:coverage

# Run backend tests (Jest)
cd server
npm test

# Lint frontend code
cd client
npm run lint
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions pipeline which:
- Runs all frontend tests (Vitest)
- Runs all backend tests (Jest)
- Lints the frontend codebase (ESLint)
