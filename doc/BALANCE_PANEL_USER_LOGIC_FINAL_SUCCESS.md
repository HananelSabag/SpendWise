## 🧮 **Your Custom Logic Implementation**

### **Daily Calculation**
```javascript
Daily Income = ₪12,000 salary ÷ 31 days = ₪387.09/day
Daily Expense = ₪5,000 rent ÷ 31 days = ₪161.29/day  
Daily Net Balance = ₪387.09 - ₪161.29 = ₪225.80/day
```

### **Weekly Calculation**
```javascript
Week Balance = Daily Balance × Days elapsed in week
// Sunday = 1 day, Monday = 2 days, Tuesday = 3 days, etc.
```

### **Monthly Calculation**
```javascript
Month Balance = All recurring (₪12,000 - ₪5,000) + one-time transactions
```

### **Yearly Calculation**
```javascript
Year Balance = Monthly pattern × 12 months
```

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Logic (Simplified)**
```javascript
// Pro-rated daily amounts from monthly recurring
const dailyIncome = recurringMonthlyIncome / daysInMonth;      // ₪387.09
const dailyExpenses = recurringMonthlyExpenses / daysInMonth;  // ₪161.29

// Weekly accumulation based on days elapsed  
const weeklyIncome = dailyIncome * daysElapsedInWeek;
const weeklyExpenses = dailyExpenses * daysElapsedInWeek;

// Monthly uses full amounts
const monthlyIncome = recurringMonthlyIncome;    // ₪12,000
const monthlyExpenses = recurringMonthlyExpenses; // ₪5,000

// Yearly projection
const yearlyIncome = monthlyIncome * 12;         // ₪144,000
const yearlyExpenses = monthlyExpenses * 12;     // ₪60,000
```

### **Smart Transaction Detection**
```javascript
// Automatically identifies recurring transactions by keywords
const recurringKeywords = ['monthly', 'salary', 'rent', 'recurring'];
const recurringTransactions = transactions.filter(t => {
  const description = (t.description || '').toLowerCase();
  return recurringKeywords.some(keyword => description.includes(keyword));
});
```
