## 🏆 **CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED AND VERIFIED**

### ✅ **DASHBOARD FUNCTION RESTORED**
**Issue**: 500 errors on dashboard due to missing `get_period_balance` function
**Solution**: Applied both function overloads (DATE and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
**Result**: Dashboard now loads correctly with accurate balance calculations

# Migration Status & Issue Tracking

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 2025-06-25: Fixed Dashboard Balance Date Range Calculations
- **Issue**: Weekly, monthly, and yearly balances were showing the same values as daily balance
- **Root Cause**: The dashboard query was using single effective_date for all periods instead of proper date ranges
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Updated `dbQueries.js` line 107-111 to use proper date ranges:
    - Daily: `effective_date` to `effective_date` (single day) ✅
    - Weekly: `week_start` to `week_start + 6 days` (full week) ✅  
    - Monthly: `month_start` to `month_start + 1 month - 1 day` (full month) ✅
    - Yearly: `year_start` to `year_start + 1 year - 1 day` (full year) ✅
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Date range calculations now work correctly

### 2025-06-25: Fixed CASE Types Mismatch Error
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL error "CASE types record and text cannot be matched" at position 3721
- **Root Cause**: CASE statement comparing DATE type with subquery that could return NULL (treated as record type)
- **Fix Applied**: Added COALESCE wrapper around MAX(date) subquery to ensure consistent DATE type
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Dashboard queries now execute without type errors

## 🔄 Database Schema Status
- Tables: ✅ All tables created and populated
- Functions: ✅ All functions working correctly
- Views: ✅ daily_balances view working properly
- Data: ✅ Recurring transactions generated correctly

## 🔧 Known Working Features
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Dashboard data loading  
- ✅ Balance calculations (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- ✅ Recurring transaction generation
- ✅ Transaction CRUD operations
- ✅ Category management

## 📝 Notes
- The `get_period_balance` function in the database is correctly implemented
- The issue was in the client-side query date range logic, not the database functions
- All balance periods now show different values based on their actual date ranges
